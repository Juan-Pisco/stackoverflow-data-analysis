1. cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located.
2. activate your virtualenv.
3. run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your prompt.

## Project Explanation

Udacity Data Science nanodegree project for developing analysis abilities with communicative and problem-solution purposes using
real industry data, python and dependencies for data wrangling as pandas. [CRISP-DM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-modeler/SaaS?topic=dm-crisp-help-overview) was the main tool or getting the job done as it is a 
way of organizing and having the main purposes clear.

## Project Files

Main files of the project are:
1. notebook_data_analysis.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook with the process of wrangling data)
2. requirements.txt (File for installing dependencies on your environment)
3. README_2020.txt (Licence of StackOverflow's survey results)
4. survey_results_public.csv (CSV containing all data rfom survey's responses)
5. survey_results_schema.csv (CVS containing questions according to each column on the data from survey_results_public.csv)
